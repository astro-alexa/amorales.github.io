								<span class="image main"><img src="images/me.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Hi! I am currently a 5th-year graduate research fellow at the University of Texas at Austin, studying galaxies that existed in the early Universe alongside Dr. Steven Finkelstein. Before moving to Austin, TX with my partner and dogs, I graduated from Florida International University in Miami, FL with a B.S. in Physics and Minors in Astronomy and Mathematics.</p>
								<p>Outside of research, I am typically found at home, beside a dog or two, reading fantasy, horror, or contemporary fiction. I also love to cook, do crosswords, play video games, discover new music, and decorate my home with new finds.</p>

								<p>I began participating in research one summer at Florida International University under Dr. James Webb (yes, this is his actual name). I helped compile archival ground-based optical data used to study microvariability in light curves of nearby AGN. The following summer (the year of the pandemic), I was selected to attend the SAO summer REU at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian. Here, I worked alongside Dr. Charlotte Mason to map out theoretical predictions for the Lyman-alpha luminosity function during the Epoch of Reionization. This project compared theoretical predictions of the shape of the luminosity function curve (as a function of the fraction of neutral hydrogen) with observations. It also helped improve the determination of the reionization timeline. I continued this project into the final year of my undergraduate career, and <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...919..120M/abstract">it was published in ApJ</a> before starting graduate school.</p>
								<p>My current research revolves around the light emitted from young, bright stars in galaxies that existed in the early Universe. As a collaborator on various HST/JWST teams, I have access to spectroscopic and photometric data used to characterize stellar populations in active star-forming galaxies.
								I primarily study how UV spectral slopes measured from UV continua relate to key galaxy properties for systems observed at Cosmic Noon and deep into the Epoch of Reionization. Using spectrophotometric SED fitting, I examine quantities such as dust attenuation and stellar mass at both the individual-galaxy and population levels. My goal is to connect the evolution of these galaxy properties to the UV spectral slope, establishing it as a powerful diagnostic of early galaxy evolution.						
								Since starting my graduate career with Dr. Steven Finkelstein, I have published three works and am currently working on two others, as discussed below. </p>

								    <h4>Star-forming Galaxies at z = 2–4 (HST/UVCANDELS) -- <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025ApJ...985..174M/abstract" target="_blank">Read the paper here</a></h4>
								    <p>
								        In this project, I measured UV spectral slopes (β) for ~17,000 galaxies in the UVCANDELS fields (PI Teplitz) at z = 2–4 using multiwavelength photometric data from ground-based imaging, HST, and Spitzer.
								        Through consistent selection and SED fitting, I found that β correlates with stellar mass and dust attenuation, with weaker trends in SFR and sSFR.
								        This work shows how stellar mass drives UV color variations during Cosmic Noon.

								    <h4>UV-faint Galaxies at z = 9–16 (JWST/NGDEEP) -- <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...964L..24M/abstract" target="_blank">Read the paper here</a></h4>
								    <p>
								        Using the extreme depth of JWST NGDEEP (PIs Finkelstein, Papovich, Pirzkal), I extended β-measurement techniques to faint, low-mass galaxies at z ~ 9–16.
								        With imaging reaching ~30.6 AB, I obtained robust UV slope and structural measurements for galaxies previously undetected in wider surveys.
								        These galaxies are blue (β ~ –2.3) but are not assumed to be pristine Pop-III populations, suggesting early chemical enrichment.

								    <h4>Best Practices for Measuring the UV Spectral Slope -- <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250703118M/abstract" target="_blank">Read the paper here</a></h4>
								    <p>
								        This work provides a unified framework for measuring β from spectra, photometry, and SED fitting.
								        Using spectroscopic slopes as a benchmark with JWST PRISM data from CEERS (PI Finkelstein) and RUBIES (PI de Graaff), I quantified the biases of common photometric methods derived from JWST NIRCam photometry and offered guidance on which methods are preferred when spectra are unavailable or noisy.
								        The paper offers practical guidelines for obtaining reliable, consistent β measurements across surveys and redshifts.

								        <h4>The Evolution of UV Slopes from z = 5–16 </h4>
								        <p>
								            This project combines photometric β measurements from UVCANDELS, NGDEEP, and upcoming surveys (CEERS, COSMOS-Web, JADES, PRIMER, GOODS-N/S) to construct a unified timeline of UV slope evolution.
								            Using SED fitting, I am mapping how stellar populations and dust content evolve with stellar mass and redshift.
								            The goal is to empirically trace the buildup of metals and dust across cosmic time, establishing the first statistically robust β–mass–redshift relation from z = 5 to 16.

								    <div class="paper-entry">
								        <h4>Intrinsic UV Slopes and Galaxy Properties with CAPERS </h4>
								        <p>
								            Using data from the JWST CAPERS spectroscopic survey (PI Dickinson), this work will analyze deep NIRSpec PRISM spectra for over 100 z > 9.5 candidates and thousands of galaxies at lower redshifts.
								            By applying best practices for measuring β, I aim to separate stellar and nebular continuum components and constrain intrinsic versus observed UV slopes.
								            Joint spectral–photometric SED fitting will provide precise estimates of dust, metallicity, and star-formation properties, enabling robust comparisons between observed and intrinsic UV continua in early galaxies.
